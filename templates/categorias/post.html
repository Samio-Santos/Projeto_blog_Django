          <p>
            A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
            these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I
            am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was
            created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear
            friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil
            existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of
            drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I
            never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley
            teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper
            surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray
            gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the
            tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the
            earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the
            buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with
            the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I
            feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image,
            and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us,
            as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend,
            when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to
            dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved
            mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could
            describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is
            living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my
            soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God! O my friend --
            but it is too much for my strength -- I sink under the weight of the
            splendour of these visions! A wonderful serenity has taken
            possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring
            which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of
            existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls
            like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the
            exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my
            talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the
            present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist
            than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me,
            and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable
            foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
            sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling
